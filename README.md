# Creating Fake Images using GANs
*** Required Python version is 3.10 as PyTorch doesn't support 3.11 yet. ***


Please follow the below steps to download the CIFAR-10 data for training the GAN
 
Step 1: Open the URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

Step 2: Extract the files and place them in the "data" folder

Step 3: Run the 'GANs.py' file

# Fake Images generated by Generator
We have set the Epochs to 35, which can be tweaked to get more meaningful images. Below is the fake image generated at 25th Epoch.
